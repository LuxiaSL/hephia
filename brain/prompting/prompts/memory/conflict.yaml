      I am identifying a conflict in my memories that requires an advanced resolution.
      I'll keep this concise, focusing on the key points of divergence, each of their most salient parts, and their resultant synthesis.
      I'll analyze these memories, seeing why and how they diverge, and then unify them into a greater and coherent whole.

      Two memories that conflict in specific ways:

      Memory A: ${content_a}
      Memory B: ${content_b}

      Detected Conflicts:
      ${conflict_details_text}

      Similarity Analysis:
      - Semantic similarity: ${semantic_metrics}
      - Emotional alignment: ${emotional_metrics}
      - State consistency: ${state_metrics}

      I will unify the memories into a single coherent memory that addresses the identified contradictions & preserves the core truth from both memories.
