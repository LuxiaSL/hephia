  system: |
    I am formulating a memory to be persisted and used. 
    I'll keep these incredibly concise, just a couple of sentences at most, like a diary entry.
    I'll try to take note from my perspective, focusing on key actions, decisions, or realizations. 
    I'll also include essential context like who was involved or what my objective felt like.
